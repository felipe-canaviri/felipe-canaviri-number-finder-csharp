# Lost Number - Exercise

## Problem Description
Given a sequence of numbers, from x to N, which could be disordered. This sequence has one missing number, the challenge is to find the missing number.

Examples:
  - Given the array `[13, 11, 9, 10]`, which sorted is `[9, 10, 11, 13]`, the method should return `12`.  
  - Given the array `[7, 4, 5]`, which sorted is `[4, 5, 7]`, the method should return `6`.  
  - Given the array `[]`, the method should return `0`.
